      <h4>Zen and the Art of Aircraft Restoration</h4>
      <p>Through my daily experience over the past two years,
        working with volunteers, I have asked myself the following
        question: What makes a volunteer dedicated to a project? The
        answer is not a straightforward one. This article explores
        the subject, much like Pirsig did in his book about
        metaphysical motorcycles; Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
        Maintenance.</p>
      <p><i>We strive for quality.</i> As restoration work
        continues on the North Star, we get absorbed into the weight
        and breadth of the subject matter. This is the kind of
        project that demands the level of commitment found in
        monasteries, dojos and Paratrooper units. Commitment comes
        from dedication and reward. Quality is obtained through
        application of commitment, producing results which may be
        enjoyed. The following effort in writing has been made to
        define such elements, those necessary to sustain the
        project.</p>
      <p><i>A voracious appetite for detail.</i> Precise facts and
        data build foundations. Foundations of information that erode
        over time. Lost to floods, fires, or worst; thieves, vandals
        and neglect. Information is our firmament that keeps us
        grounded in our work. Daily worksheets are filled with steps
        taken to satisfy a condition. Drawings are made to translate
        reality to paper. These words, drawings and tables form hard
        to translate time lines. Coloured bars overtaking each other,
        running in thousand hour blocks of volunteer contributions.
        These life hours, cannot be overlooked, as a restoration
        project advances through the years.</p>
      <p><i>Inorganic compounds risk distraction.</i> Focus is
        important when avoiding the ethereal draw of solvents. A
        volunteer scrubber, washing away years of residue, layered
        upon a finish that once gleamed with pride. Slowing the
        return to dust, so feared and fought by the living. A process
        to follow and adhere to. The methodical dismantling and
        reconstruction of an object. Return to form, that which was
        almost indiscernable. The result of all his work is not
        merely a shiny piece of aluminium panelling; He has travelled
        through time.</p>
      <p><i>More than just an object, we look to a hidden past.</i>
        Beyond these material trappings, lay the history of Canadair
        North Star 17515 and her sisters. Examples of service are
        easily found in books and photos. What proves a challenge is
        explaining how a bumblebee becomes a preserved specimen in an
        engine, how graffiti made during heavy maintenance is the
        only evidence of a man's past. Where the dirt under
        floorboards, came from countries that no longer bear the name
        she visited.</p>
      <p><i>The static, prevents complete appreciation.</i> She's
        more than 45,000 lbs. of metal. Superficial understanding can
        only consider her 39 years an outdoor relic. Likewise, so
        would a skin deep treatment of a last remaining artefact of
        this type. What impact she had before the stillness of the
        seasons is not lost to those who look further.</p>
      <p><i>A biological experience in personal evolution.</i> The
        volunteer has developed new muscles and sinew adapted to
        producing polished surfaces. An eye for microtexture and
        grain direction has developed. Sympathetic scars are
        accumulated through careful little sacrifices. Navigating the
        disruptions of capricious human needs such as rest,
        nourishment and leisure. Through the application of labour, a
        piece of history is preserved.</p>
      <p><i>Disappearing horizons.</i> Meditative expanses of
        aluminum, exhibiting varieties of corrosion rarely
        encountered in a lifetime’s career. Cavernous interior
        spaces, where cargo of all sorts was bound for ports beyond.
        Flight control surfaces that have pressed through all shades
        of dusk, emerging in the dawn of a new day. Now removed from
        the ship, these weathered, beaten, bruised remnants of a
        glorious past await restoration. A new horizon forms, some
        many years away, known to those who are on-board for the long
        run.</p>
      <p><i>Healthy obsessions.</i> Volunteer restoration
        technicians take home an experience. They take to heart the
        results of their labour, in forming a product that is also
        intangible. The mind has strengthened, forming resolves that
        assist, understand and process the elements of restoration
        work. As historians, fanatics and unwitting library wanderers
        soon discover; The story of air transport, in its beginning,
        is far from just a few obscure paragraphs in Canada’s ongoing
        history. It lives through those people who continue writing
        it, preserving the physical, extending beyond.</p>
